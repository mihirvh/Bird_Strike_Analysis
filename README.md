## Key Findings

1. **Increasing Bird Strikes**:
      - Bird strikes have shown an **5-8% annual increase** over the last 10 years.
2. **Species Impact**:
      - **60%** of bird strikes involve smaller bird species, while **25%** involve medium-sized species and **15%** involve larger birds.
3. **High-Risk Airports**:
      - Dallas Airport accounts for approximately **20% of all reported bird strikes**, the highest among surveyed airports.
4. **Aircraft Size and Damage**:
      - **Smaller aircraft** are involved in **70% of bird strike** incidents compared to 30% for larger aircraft.
5. **Wildlife and Cost Implications**:
      - Bird strike-related costs (damage, delays, etc.) have risen by **15% annually**, reaching an estimated **$500 million industry-wide** in the last reported year.
6. **Critical Phases of Flight**:
      - **65%** of bird strikes occur during critical phases such as take-off and landing.
7. **Regulatory and Operational Compliance**:
      - **60%** of bird remains are **not collected and documented**, with over **90% not sent for analysis to institutions like the Smithsonian**.

## Recommendations:
1. Enhanced Monitoring and Warning Systems:
    - Implementation of Advanced Radar Systems near airports in real-time, improving situational awareness.
2. Targeted Wildlife Management
    - Habitat Modification to eliminate or reduce vegetation to deter bird activity.
    - Species-Specific deterrents to be deployed specially for smaller and medium-sized birds, .
3. Focused Attention on High-Risk Airports
    - Priority Interventions at Dallas Airport including enhanced monitoring and dedicated wildlife management teams.
    - Data-Driven Risk Assessment by conducting regular audits of bird strike data to identify evolving high-risk airports and address local conditions.
4. Cost Mitigation Strategies
    - Preventive Maintenance Protocols Regular inspections and timely repairs can mitigate escalating repair costs associated with bird strikes.
    - Insurance and Partnerships: Negotiate favorable insurance policies and collaborate with wildlife agencies to share costs for implementing prevention measures.
5. Improved Reporting and Documentation
    - Standardized Procedures: Mandate thorough collection and analysis of bird remains after every incident to improve data accuracy.
    - Collaboration with Research Institutions: Partner with institutions like the Smithsonian to identify bird species and refine mitigation strategies based on species behavior.
6. Training and Awareness
    - Specialized Pilot Training: Train pilots on emergency protocols to handle bird strikes, especially during critical phases of flight.
    - Awareness Campaigns: Educate airport staff on effective wildlife management practices and the importance of documenting bird strike incidents.
